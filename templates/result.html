        <strong>Stage 4 CKD means you have an eGFR between 15 and 29.</strong> <br>An eGFR between 15 and 30 means your kidneys are moderately or severely damaged and are not working as they should. Stage 4 kidney disease should be taken very seriously â€“ it is the last stage before kidney failure.

At Stage 4 kidney disease, many people have symptoms such as:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Swelling in your hands and feet</li>
          <li>Back pain</li>
          <li>Urinating (peeing) more or less than normal</li>
        </ul><br>
        At Stage 4, you will likely also have health complications as waste builds up in your body and your kidneys are not working well, such as:
        <ul>
          <li>High blood pressure </li>
          <li>Anemia (a low number of red blood cells)</li>
          <li>Bone disease</li>
        </ul><br>
        To keep kidney disease from getting worse at this stage, your doctor will recommend that you:
        <ul>
          <li>Have regular appointments with a nephrologist (kidney doctor), who will make a treatment plan that is right for you and tell you how often you will need to have your kidneys checked </li>
          <li>Meet with a dietitian, who will help you follow a healthy diet </li>
          <li>Take special blood pressure medicines like ACE inhibitors and ARBs if your doctor says you should. If you have diabetes or high blood pressure, sometimes these medicines can help keep kidney disease from getting worse.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Stage 5 CKD means you have an eGFR less than 15.</strong> <br>An eGFR less than 15 means the kidneys are getting very close to failure or have completely failed.

        <ul>
          <li>Itching</li>
